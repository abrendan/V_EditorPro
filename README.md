# V_EditorPro

This is a simple pre-Windows 11 notepad clone written in .NET 4.8.

## Features

- Simple notes taking (not like Windows 11's Notepad)
- Automatically sets the current date as the default file name
- Wider file type support
- More modern .NET Version than V_EditorClassic (No additional install of .NET needed)

### Operating System Support

For now I only have tested Windows 11. Windows 10 - Windows 7 should be working fine too though.
